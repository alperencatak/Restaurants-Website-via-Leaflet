ðŸŒ€ __Entrance__: 

The task assigned to us involves the development of a web-based application for geospatial data management, focusing on using a web framework and integrating the geographic aspect through OpenLayers. Primary goals include implementing functions such as data filtering, insertion, and deletion, as well as user authentication and authorization to accommodate different levels of access. OpenLayers, an open-source JavaScript library for displaying maps, is instrumental in incorporating the geographic features required for the project.

ðŸŒ€ __Basic functions__:

ðŸ’» __Data Filtering__: The application allows users to filter data based on specific attributes. For example, users can choose to view only cafes with a score of 4.5 and above. Similarly, when shopping on a website, it provides convenience for people to choose to shop from sellers with a score above 4. This improves user experience by providing relevant and targeted information.

ðŸ’» __Adding Data__: The interface provides a mechanism for adding new data. Thanks to the database we have created, the data on our site is updated instantly. In this way, the application stays up to date with the latest information and coordinate data.

ðŸ’» __Data Deletion__: The app allows users to delete existing data through a user-friendly interface. This functionality is critical to maintaining data accuracy and validity over time. Again, this is a necessary process for up-to-dateness. We must remove a cafe that is no longer in place.

ðŸŒ€ __Summary__:

In summary, in this project: We are in an effort to develop a web-based application focusing on Geospatial data management. The project emphasizes application security with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Measures such as regular updates, encryption, and secure coding practices have been taken to minimize security risks. Using OpenLayers, geospatial data is effectively managed through a user-friendly interface. The application organizes access to geospatial data on a role-based basis, providing users with filtering, adding and deleting capabilities. Future enhancements include more advanced filtering options, integration with additional mapping APIs and optimization for mobile devices. The project focuses on the goal of becoming a long-lasting application, addressing security concerns through regular updates and maintenance.

ðŸŒ€ __Challenges We Encountered and Possible Solutions__:

An important goal was to implement strong user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure the security of our application. We have tried to take measures to minimize security risks, such as regular updates, encryption and secure coding practices. Our proposed web-based application successfully meets the stated requirements by offering a user-friendly interface for geospatial data management. The effective use of OpenLayers provides a modern solution. Future enhancements may include the addition of more comprehensive filtering options, integration with additional mapping APIs, and optimization for mobile devices. Regular updates and maintenance are required to address security concerns and ensure the longevity of the app.

ðŸŒ€ __Web Developing__:

Restaurant data created using "PostgreSQL" was used with the help of "JavaScript". As a result, "Live Server", a "VS Code" add-on, published the written website to us via "128.0.0.1", that is, "localhost". The restaurant added to this database in the desired format will appear on the website.

There are two filters available on the website. The first of these is "rating" and the second is "districts" filters.

The rating filter allows you to display the average restaurant score, which is a result of the evaluation of restaurants by real users, and the scores between 3 and 5 with the help of a slider.

The Districts filter is a filter that helps show restaurants in your area of residence. By selecting the district name from the filter tool, it filters out the restaurants on the map that do not interest you.

The control units located on the left contain buttons to zoom in and out of the map and show the current location.

Here is the "District" filter.

And restaurants in "Ã‡ankaya" filtered by "4.4" points.

And we can gather info from pop-up as well.

ðŸŒ€ __The process of renewing the project__:

In our project, we first encountered such a react error. then we started our project again. In our project, this time we created a database instead of pulling live data from google. we aimed to provide up-to-date data on our site by continuously updating the data in this SQL-based database. The process we did was successful and we uploaded the current data from our database to our web page using java script. We did the necessary checks on our web page and did not encounter any errors. We added the video of our project to our report.
